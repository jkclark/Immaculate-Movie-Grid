## Local development
Notes:
- If you want to hit the TMDB API (or really use any environment variables), you need to have a `.env` in the directory from which you are executing code.

### Required env vars
The following environment variables must be defined (e.g., in a `.env` file) in order to run this code locally:
- `TMDB_API_KEY`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
